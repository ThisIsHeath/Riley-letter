Hi, Riley!

So basically I'm not super great with web
development and stuff so this is admittedly
a little jankily put together. I hope that
you have a 1080p monitor because the whole
thing falls apart at different resolutions.
In the case that you DON'T have a 1080p
monitor, you'll have to zoom out a bit,
which kinda messes with the formatting,
but whatever.

Do NOT move any of the files from the flash
drive; it should all run right off of it.

I don't know why you would even attempt it,
but the letter does NOT work on phones.
I'm really testing this thing to the max.

Anyways, that should be it. I really hope it
works AHHHHH okay enjoy the letter!

(UPDATE - 8:27 P.M.)
Holy shit debugging this whole thing kicked
my ass but now it should theoretically run
pretty perfectly!
